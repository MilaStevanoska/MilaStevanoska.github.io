    <p>In 2017 I was a first year student at SUGS "Josip Broz Tito" Skopje.Accordingly, I graduated from JBT in 2021.
    During the 4 years of highschool I was most dedicated to my physical health and my knowledge in mathematics and computer science.
        In 3rd year we had an option to choose what topics we want to study,whether we want to study science or sociology.My pick was PMA which most contains mathematics.

        After getting a degree from this faculty,my plan is to get some more practical knowledge
        and after that I would like to work for some company or as a freelancer.
        Parallelly I'm planning to finish some junior college for being a volleyball coach because I love playing this sport and working with kids.
