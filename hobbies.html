  <p >As a person with many ambitions, I value the free time I get. I enjoy reading books (most of them psychological) and analysing them. I ride my bike almost every day and I consider it one
    of the best means of transportation.Besides using it as a transport, one of my hobby is mountain biking and camping.There is an unexplainable beauty in the
    camping and biking for which I'm not sure if I can describe it at it's best.

        <p class="text">Not everyone feels safe about camping and that is all normal and okay. <br>
            If you want to go camping you need to carefully pick the place and people to go with, also a good organization plan.On the contrary of the struggles is the beauty of the nature
        which cannot be seen in the city life.</p></div>
